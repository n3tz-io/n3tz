              As a service provider, we are responsible for our own content on these pages in accordance
              with § 7 para. 1 DDG and general laws. However, according to §§ 8 to 10 DDG, we are not
              obligated as a service provider to monitor transmitted or stored third-party information
              or to investigate circumstances that indicate illegal activity.

              Obligations to remove or block the use of information under general laws remain unaffected.

              Our offer contains links to external third-party websites over whose content we have no
              influence. Therefore, we cannot assume any liability for this external content. The respective
              provider or operator of the pages is always responsible for the content of the linked pages.
              The linked pages were checked for possible legal violations at the time of linking. Illegal
              content was not identifiable at the time of linking.
            </p>
            <p class="mt-2">
              However, permanent content control of the linked pages is not reasonable without concrete
              evidence of a legal violation. Upon becoming aware of legal violations, we will remove such
              links immediately.
