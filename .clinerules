# n3tz.io Project Intelligence

## Project Context
This is a rebranding project for n3tz.io, a web development business website built with Astro. The goal is to move away from "collective" positioning to a more professional service provider image while maintaining technical credibility.

## Key User Preferences
- Likes the current design overall - keep visual aesthetic
- Avoid the word "agency" unless absolutely necessary
- Make it clear that n3tz can handle ANY size project (not just large ones)
- Want more professional, modern copy
- Need clear differentiation from personal brand (tarik.n3tz.io)

## Technical Patterns
- **Framework**: Astro 4.2.1 with TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom color scheme (hot pink/orange theme)
- **Content**: Configuration-driven via src/config.yaml
- **i18n**: 4 languages (EN, DE, FR, ES) with route-based structure
- **Deployment**: Netlify auto-deploy from main branch

## Content Strategy Insights
- Current positioning as "collective of passionate developers" is too informal
- Need to emphasize service range from small websites to enterprise applications
- Portfolio projects (OdinBoost, LendeXe, Statement Clothing) are strong - keep but reframe
- FAQ section needs updating to reflect new professional positioning

## File Structure Patterns
- Main content updates needed in: src/pages/index.astro, src/config.yaml
- Multi-language versions in: src/pages/de/, src/pages/fr/, src/pages/es/
- Component-based architecture with widgets for major page sections

## Messaging Framework Direction
- Position as "web development studio" or "development partner" 
- Emphasize custom solutions for any project size
- Maintain technical expertise credibility
- Professional but approachable tone
- Clear value proposition around turning ideas into digital reality

## Memory Bank Structure
Complete memory bank created with:
- projectbrief.md: Core rebranding goals and constraints
- productContext.md: What n3tz.io is and problems it solves
- systemPatterns.md: Technical architecture and design patterns
- techContext.md: Development environment and dependencies
- activeContext.md: Current focus and rebranding decisions
- progress.md: What works, issues, and implementation phases

## Next Steps Pattern
1. Content strategy finalization
2. Hero section updates (highest impact)
3. About section professional repositioning
4. Service range clarification
5. Multi-language rollout
