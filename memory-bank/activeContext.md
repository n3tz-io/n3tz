# Active Context: n3tz.io Rebranding

## Current Focus
Rebranding the n3tz.io website to position it as a professional web development service that can handle projects of any size, moving away from the "collective" positioning while maintaining technical credibility.

## Recent Analysis
- **Current Positioning**: "Collective of passionate developers" - too informal for business clients
- **Service Scope Issue**: Messaging suggests focus only on "big projects" and "web shops"
- **Brand Confusion**: Need clearer differentiation from personal brand (tarik.n3tz.io)
- **Content Quality**: Copy needs to be more professional and modern

## Key Rebranding Decisions

### Terminology Changes
- **Avoid**: "Collective", "Agency" (per user preference)
- **Consider**: "Studio", "Team", "Development Partner", "Web Development Service"
- **Focus**: Professional service provider rather than community/collective

### Messaging Strategy
- **Expand Service Range**: Make it clear we handle ALL project sizes
- **Professional Tone**: More business-focused, less community-focused
- **Value Proposition**: Emphasize custom solutions and technical expertise
- **Differentiation**: Clear distinction from personal freelance brand

### Content Areas for Update
1. **Hero Section**: New headline and subtitle
2. **About Section**: Professional service description vs collective story
3. **Services Section**: Broader range of capabilities
4. **Portfolio**: Maintain current projects but reframe context
5. **FAQ**: Update to reflect new positioning
6. **Meta Description**: Update SEO descriptions

## Next Steps Priority
1. **Content Strategy**: Define new messaging framework
2. **Copy Updates**: Rewrite key sections with professional tone
3. **Visual Refresh**: Subtle design updates to feel more current
4. **SEO Updates**: Update meta descriptions and titles
5. **Multi-language**: Apply changes across all language versions
