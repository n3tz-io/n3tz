# Project Brief: n3tz.io Rebranding

## Project Overview
Rebrand the n3tz.io business website to better position it as a professional development service provider that can handle projects of any size, from small websites to large-scale web applications and e-commerce solutions.

## Current State
- **Domain**: n3tz.io (business website) vs tarik.n3tz.io (personal profile)
- **Technology**: Astro-based website with modern tech stack
- **Current Positioning**: "Collective of developers" focused on big projects/web shops
- **Current Description**: "n3tz is a collective of passionate developers offering advanced web application development"

## Rebranding Goals
1. **Expand Service Perception**: Make it clear that n3tz can handle ANY type of project, not just large ones
2. **Professional Positioning**: Move away from "collective" language while maintaining collaborative spirit
3. **Modern Content**: Update copy to be more professional and current
4. **Design Refresh**: Keep existing design but make it feel more "up to date"
5. **Terminology**: Avoid "agency" unless it's the most fitting term

## Key Constraints
- User likes the current design overall
- Avoid the word "agency" if possible
- Need to differentiate from personal brand (tarik.n3tz.io)
- Maintain technical credibility

## Success Criteria
- Clear messaging about service range (small to large projects)
- Professional, modern copy
- Updated visual elements that feel current
- Distinct positioning from personal brand
- Improved conversion potential

## Target Audience
- Businesses needing web development services
- Entrepreneurs with project ideas
- Companies requiring e-commerce solutions
- Organizations needing custom web applications
